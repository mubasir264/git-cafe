Saudi Arabian Kahwa, also known as Qahwa, is a traditional coffee often flavored with cardamom and sometimes saffron. Hereâ€™s how you can make it:

Ingredients:

3 tablespoons of lightly roasted coffee beans
3 cups of water
3 whole cardamom pods
A pinch of saffron strands (optional)
Sugar or dates to serve on the side (optional)

Instructions:

Grind the coffee beans to a fine consistency.
Crush the cardamom pods slightly to release their flavor.
In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil.
Add the ground coffee and crushed cardamom pods to the boiling water.
If using saffron, add it to the saucepan as well.
Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10-15 minutes. The longer you simmer, the stronger the flavor will be.
Strain the Kahwa into a serving pot or directly into cups.
Serve hot with sugar or dates on the side for sweetening if desired.
Enjoy your Saudi Arabian Kahwa!
