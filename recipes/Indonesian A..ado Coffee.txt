Brewing Aceh Gayo coffee using a pour-over method can highlight its unique flavors. Here’s a simple recipe:

Ingredients:

2 tablespoons of Aceh Gayo coffee beans
Hot water (just off the boil at about 205°F or 96°C)
Sugar or sweetener (optional)

Instructions:

Grind your Aceh Gayo coffee beans to a medium-fine consistency, similar to table salt.
Place a filter in your pour-over brewer and rinse it with hot water to remove any paper taste and preheat the brewer.
Add the ground coffee to the filter.
Start pouring hot water slowly over the grounds, starting from the center and moving outward in a spiral motion. Pour just enough water to saturate the grounds and 
let it “bloom” for about 30 seconds.
Continue pouring the water in stages, allowing the coffee to drip through before adding more water.
Once you’ve poured all the water, let the coffee finish dripping.
Remove the brewer, discard the grounds, and serve the coffee.
You can adjust the amount of coffee and water to suit your taste preference. If you like your coffee sweet, add sugar or your preferred sweetener.

Enjoy your freshly brewed Aceh Gayo coffee!
