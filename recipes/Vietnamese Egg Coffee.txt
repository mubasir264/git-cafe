Vietnamese Egg Coffee, or Cà Phê Trứng, is a traditional Vietnamese drink that’s both rich and creamy. Here’s how to make it:

Ingredients:

1 egg yolk
3 teaspoons of Vietnamese coffee powder
2 teaspoons of sweetened condensed milk
Boiling water
1 cup of hot, strong brewed coffee (preferably Vietnamese coffee)

Instructions:

Brew a cup of strong coffee using Vietnamese coffee powder and boiling water. If you have a Vietnamese coffee filter (phin), use it for an authentic experience.
Separate the egg yolk from the white and place the yolk in a bowl.
Add the sweetened condensed milk to the egg yolk.
Use a hand mixer or whisk to beat the yolk and condensed milk until the mixture is fluffy and forms stiff peaks.
Pour the hot coffee into a cup, leaving some space at the top.
Gently spoon the whipped egg mixture on top of the coffee.
Serve immediately with a small spoon to stir the egg cream into the coffee before drinking.
Enjoy your Vietnamese Egg Coffee!
