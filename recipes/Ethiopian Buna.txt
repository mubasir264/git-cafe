Ethiopian Buna (coffee) is traditionally prepared in a ceremony that involves roasting green coffee beans and brewing the coffee in a pot called a ‘jebena’. Here’s a 
simplified version of the recipe:

Ingredients:

Green coffee beans
Water
Sugar or salt (optional)

Instructions:

Start by washing your green coffee beans to remove any debris.
Roast the beans in a pan over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally to prevent burning. The beans will first turn yellow, then brown, and they’ll start to crackle. 
Roast them to your preferred level of darkness.
Once roasted, grind the beans to a medium-fine consistency.
Boil water in the jebena or a regular kettle if you don’t have one.
Add the ground coffee to the jebena and pour in the hot water. Allow it to steep for a few minutes.
Slowly pour the coffee into cups, trying not to disturb the grounds settled at the bottom.
Serve black or with sugar or a pinch of salt, as per tradition.
