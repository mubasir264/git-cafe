Maple-Oat Sticky Cake is a delightful treat that combines the flavors of maple syrup and oats. Here’s a recipe for you to try:

Ingredients:

1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
1 cup of rolled oats
1/2 cup of unsalted butter, melted
1 cup of pure maple syrup
1/2 cup of brown sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup of milk
1 teaspoon of baking powder
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

For the Sticky Topping:

1/2 cup of pure maple syrup
1/4 cup of unsalted butter
1/4 cup of heavy cream

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In another bowl, whisk together the melted butter, maple syrup, brown sugar, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract until well combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
While the cake is baking, make the sticky topping by combining maple syrup, butter, and heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer 
and cook until thickened slightly.
Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and immediately pour the sticky topping over it.
Allow the cake to cool slightly before serving.
Enjoy your Maple-Oat Sticky Cake!
